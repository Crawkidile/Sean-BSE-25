# Magic Mirror
A smart mirror is an innovative device that integrates a reflective surface with a digital display, providing real-time information such as weather updates and news. It also provides extensive customization opportunities, allowing you to display all sorts of information. This incorporates the use of a mirror with the usefull features of electronic devices.

My project is the MagicMirror, which combines the use of a mirror with a personal assistant. The initial components that I used were a Raspberry Pi 4, which is used to power the Mirror, and a 7" LCD Screen, to display it on. The LCD Screen connects to the Raspberry Pi via an HDMI connection. So far, I managed to install the MagicMirror Operating System on the Raspberry Pi itself, with both Node.js and npm. I also managed to connect the Pi to the screen and have customized the display to include useful information such as the weather, the time, and CPU information.

One challenge that I faced arose when I tried to use the `MMM-Touch` module, as it seemed that even though the display came with touchscreen capabilities, the module wouldn't receive or recognize any of the inputs I gave (by touching the screen). I decided to just go through without using `MMM-Touch`, as there were other modules that also used touch-recognition that worked fine. I plan to try and experiment with it a little more in future milestones; however, for now, I am at a good place.

I plan to add at least a couple of modifications to my MagicMirror, such as motion sensing capabilities, Bluetooth, and possibly more.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

Below is the `./config/config.js` file
```js
/* Config Sample
 *
 * For more information on how you can configure this file
 * see https://docs.magicmirror.builders/configuration/introduction.html
 * and https://docs.magicmirror.builders/modules/configuration.html
 *
 * You can use environment variables using a `config.js.template` file instead of `config.js`
 * which will be converted to `config.js` while starting. For more information
